# ADF_Test
#ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) test is a statistical significance test which means the test will give results in hypothesis tests with null and alternative hypotheses. As a result, we will have a p-value from which we will need to make inferences about the time series, whether it is stationary or not.
